    By Sharon Dagan <idagan@il.ibm.com>


    v0.05 (25/12/1998 18:30)
          * Added a GUI - NICE/2 now adds 'Priority' menu to the Task List
            Window's context menu.
          * Added verbose mode '-v' to ease debugging.
          * Added NICEX to start process in a given priority.

    v0.04 (18/12/1998 16:00)
          * Minor change to the engine so NICE/2 wont hold up OS/2 shutdown.

    v0.03 (16/12/1998 12:30)
          * Engine redesign (again). Engine now runs as a thread within the
            PM process, and listens to it's own queue, no need to use Win*
            APIs to contact the engine.
          * Engine reports back rc codes.
          * Engine posts event semaphore to indicate end of request.
          * PIDs are checked before any other work is done.
          * If TID is given, the PID type is checked (must be PM).
          * Better error reporting.
          * Added RXNICE.DLL - a REXX interface into NICE/2.
          * Added NICE.H and NICE.LIB for C developers.

    v0.02 (31/07/1998 18:50)
          * Complete redesign of the niced engine. Nice/2 is now able to
            change the priority of selected single thread within a PM process.
          * Added NICEPS to report priorities.
          * Improved debug version of NICE/2.
          * Nice/2 now reports detailed information on many possible errors.

    v0.01 beta 2 (30/07/1998 16:30)
          * Bug fix - could not get the TLW HWND in non-US-English versions
            of OS/2.

    v0.01 beta 1 (21/07/1998 02:00)
          * First public release.
