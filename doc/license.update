No, nice-os2-v50.zip makes OS/2 (and winos2) look nicer. Nice/2 works sorta
like the
Unix command nice. V4 is on Hobbes.
(http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/util/process/nice004.zip). Also used as a
plugin to
watchcat. (http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/util/process/wnice.zip) I have
ver 7 or so
here but no source and it's GPL so no distributing allowed.
Sharon are you the sole copyright holder? It appears so in the files I
have. If so could
you relicense it to allow me to redistribute it without the source if I
can't find the source.
Dave
